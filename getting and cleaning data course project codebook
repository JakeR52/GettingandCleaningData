## Project Description
From the assignment page:
"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Study design and data processing
 
###Collection of the raw data
Date was downloaded from the provided link.  Data acquisition is decsribed as follows:
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
"
###Notes on the original (raw) data 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description:
 - Data table is 180 x 68
 - final table is grouped by "Subject" and then "Exercise" to show an average for each variable that was either a mean or STD of a measured variable(see project description step #5)
  - Variables present in the dataset
  
      Feature Selection 
    =================
    
    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals (XYX axis body accelleration time signals and XYZ axis gyroscope time signals) and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
    
    Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (body acceleration and gyroscope jerk signals). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (mean of Body 3D accelleration magnitude,mean of Gravity 3D accelleration magnitude,mean of Body Jerk 3D accelleration magnitude,mean of Body 3D Gyroscope magnitude,mean of Body Jerk 3D Gyroscope magnitude). 
    
    Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals. 
    
    These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
    '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
